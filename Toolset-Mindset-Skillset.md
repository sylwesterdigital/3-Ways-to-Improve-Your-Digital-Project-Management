**Today we're talking about three ways to improve your digital project management** 

Well today we're seeing that digital transformation continues with existing companies we also see that digital implementations expand with new companies and startups so more and more having a digital mindset is a must 

and we're seeing that some companies are innovating some really cool ways to work so on this whiteboard session today we want to think about 

 1. toolset 
 2. mindset 
 3. skillset

**hire a project manager**

well again when we think about toolset mindset and skillset think about this hire 


someone who **has digital project management experience**


in training well because digital transformation and digital project management has been out for some time so now we can find people with the expertise but sometimes it's not possible so if not we want to 


find **someone who is committed to getting training**


on these things again tool sets what new tools are out there today that assist and help with digital project management we also want to look at some approaches for digital project management they're also now some 

**best practices in industries**

and different verticals that you may be in if your company is beginning to implement it across different organizations you can leverage those also organize your projects better so again we're talking about digital project management and the management of the projects so 

look beyond Google Docs

**set up an online repository**

that's **easy to access** access by all organize things by projects so it makes sense for **people on teams** to be able to go to those projects and find files that they need and then **consistent naming conventions** and **filing structure** so when you're dealing with multiple people on your team or vendor part even some of your customers or stakeholders **you want people to be able to go and be able to find things that make sense** also we want to 

**create a digital strategy**

be able to **define how to manage the projects** the clients that you're working with and also your vendor partners and number three track client facing concerns this is where teams organizations and companies can really score big this is becoming more and more important every day so 

be able to **have a way to document their concerns** assess

what they are and who maybe **they need to be assigned** to be able to **track the status** and be able to close them out to **keep the customer informed** about what's going on
